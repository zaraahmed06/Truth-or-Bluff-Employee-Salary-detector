# Truth-or-Bluff-Employee-Salary-detector
Is the employee bluffing?
A human Resource Team working for hiring a new Employee.The new Employee seems to be great and good fit for the job and the human resource team is about to make an offer.
In the beginning of the salary negotiation,the employee says that he has had 20+ years of experience and his previous salary was 160000
The HR team collects data for different position levels and associated salaries
Default:Every position level requires 4 year experience to hop to another level.
The employee says he was a reigon Manager and now he is halfway to become a partner
I started with linear regression then found its not appropriate as there was a nonlinear relationship between position and salary.
Then hopped to Polynomial regression(Not a suitable approach as it takes less complexities and gives unsatisfactory results)
Random forest regression was the best fit with 300 decision trees.
So lets proceed and start up our Machine Learning!!
